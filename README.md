# Question-answering-system-for-VIT-chennai-website-chatbot
We propose a question answering system based chatbot which can be embedded into the college website which helps to solve the draw- backs of a traditional collage website where users or students find it difficult to find the information which they are looking. The university question answering system-based Chat- bot will provide an answer by summarizing the question and providing the relevant answer. It also provides selective information about what the user wants. A university chatbot will provide all the answers related to areas like admission, test box, bulletin board, attendance, placement box and others. We have taken a lot of pre-defined questions relating to all the possible queries that a user would like to know or ask a chatbot in a collage website or university perspective domain. And in the pre- defined query dataset we have divided all the queries or questions into a certain class where they would fit and for all the available question sentences, we have divided it into unique lemmatized words and when a query is posted the ML algorithm will take the query and find all the unique lemmatized words and match it with the available query dataset and will classify it into any one of the available classes and respond with a suitable more precise answer.
